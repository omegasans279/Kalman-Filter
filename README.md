# Kalman-Filter
#_Where the hell am I?_
#In this project, youll be working with a linear system (such as a spring-mass type) and there will be a sensor that will give you position readings. I want you to implement Kalman Filter for this setup and ensure that your state estimates do converge to the true states.
